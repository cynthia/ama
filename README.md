# Ask Me Anything

This is an educational experiment, where budding software engineers ask me about
somewhat uncomfortable topics which can be explained in simpler ways than how it
is introduced in books. These would normally be topics that were taught in rather
convoluted, unnecessary forms in a conventional classroom.

The idea here is that having a primer on a rather complex topic explained in easier
terms would potentially help the audience to go home and dig into the topic further.

# Topics

These are topics that have been requested so far, in chronological request order.

1. [Game Theory Basics](/game-theory): Basic game theory and what a Nash Equilibrium is.
2. [Complexity](/complexity): Gentle introduction to computational complexity theory, with examples of common algorithms and it's O complexity.
3. [transistor-logic](/transistor-logic): Logic gates with transistors - the most basic building block of modern computing.
4. [web-history](/web-history): The history of the world wide web.
5. [Locks](/locks): What locks (in programming) are, how to use them, and when and not to use them.

The notes used for each talk will be shared in the individual topic folder, after
the talk has happened.

A simple readme will be provided in the topic directory for each topic, along with
further reading pointers which will be a combination of links, papers, and books.

# Topic Suggestions

Topic suggestions are expected to sent in in a form of a [pull request](https://github.com/cynthia/ama/pulls).

Topics may get rejected. General rules of thumb are noted below.

## Rules

I don't have enough time to sit down and make nice slides for each talk. The talks
are expected to be on topics which are presentable on a whiteboard. (or chalkboard,
depending on the location this is being presented)

Generic topics which can be useful to as many people as possible is strongly preferred,
meaning language/library specific topics will most likely be of lower priority than
generic computing/programming topics.

On that note, a topic which requires a reasonable amount of prior knowledge (e.g.
linear algebra would be an example) is most likely to be rejected.

I obviously have limited knowledge, and in the event I don't know anything about a
requested topic - that will most likely get rejected.
